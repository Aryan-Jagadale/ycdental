     "Shiv Jayanti or Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Jayanti is the birth anniversary of Maratha king Shivaji. Shiv Jayanti is celebrated on February 19 every year in his honour.The creator and founder of the Maratha Empire, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was born in 1630 at Shivneri Fort near Pune.He was named after a regional Goddess Shivai. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was formally crowned as the Chhatrapati, or emperor of the Maratha Empire, in 1674. The coronation took place at the Raigad fort. Shivaji promoted the use of Marathi and Sanskrit in court and administration, rather than using Persian which was the norm in those times." }
